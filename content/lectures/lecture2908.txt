1. PLC : 5 -> X ambiguedad debido a la multiple funcionalidad  
2. RASPBERRY: 1
3. BRAZO ROBÓTICO: 3 
4. SISTEMA METEREOLÓGICO: 5 

------------

# characteristics of an embebid: 
 - always reviwe the requirements 
 - on lynux, its implmeneted as low level and use data register method. 
 
 * 

system definition : a system is more than the sum of its parts. 


    * system is a set of interrelated components working together toward some purpose.
    * has to have a CPU and a memory or recorder data. 

MCU: requires memory managment. 

----------------
in order to know if implement lynyx it is a good strategie: 

1. review hardware access (drivers via or direct as BARE-METAL)

2. time needed to elaborate the project 

3. 
 ie, not always its the strategie, also existe FreeRTOS, VxWorks, QNX, zephyr ,etc. selection dependes on 
objectives and project scope. 

embbeded on linux, debbian, (andorid uses on their core, a linux implementation),etc are the most used on art state. 



-----------
# super loop concept : 
# LINUX IS A KERNEL : 

# about a differences between a OS and a KERNEL:  

* linux kernel is the core of the OS, it manages the resources and implemetates protocols of communication 
between hardware and software. 

* a kernel is a first abstraction , anyways, the OS is of the last layers of abstraction on the OS. 

# GNU linux tools used for develop 
-> UNIX based operative system -> based on C language(created for this purpose)
-> minix based on A MICROKERNEL ARCHITECTURE ¿? 

# what it is a distribution?  -> differentes architectures or OS based on linux kernel. 
# differentes between compilated and interpretared DEVELOP LANGUAGES.
