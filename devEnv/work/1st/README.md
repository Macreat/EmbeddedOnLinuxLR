# 1ST ASSIGNMENT

class-room description :

Write a C project that reads the information at /proc/stat, /proc/cpuinfo and /proc/meminfo periodically (every two seconds), and show in the screen:

- How much installed memory the system has.
- How much physical and virtual memory is being used.
- What kind of processor the system has.
- How many cores are present in the system.
- The system processor load per core.
  The project should be version-controlled using git, either locally or in the cloud (Github, Gitlab, ...).

TIP: You can use a text-user-interface (TUI) library to present the information on screen.
